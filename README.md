# Exploratory Data Analysis on Superstore Dataset

## Overview
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Sample Superstore dataset**.  
The main goal is to uncover insights about:
- Sales and Profit trends  
- Customer behavior  
- Regional and product-level performance

**Main Findings:**
- A small number of customers contribute to a large portion of total sales.  
- Some product categories generate **high sales but low profit**, indicating potential issues with pricing or discount strategy.  
- Certain regions consistently underperform, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis  
- **CSV** data source

## Next Steps
- Build an interactive dashboard using **Tableau, PowerBI, or Plotly Dash**  
- Develop a predictive model to forecast **Sales** or **Profit**  
- Perform customer segmentation (e.g., using RFM analysis or clustering)
